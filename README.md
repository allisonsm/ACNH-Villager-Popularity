# Animal Crossing New Horizons: Villager Analysis with SQL

## Introduction

The Google Data Analytics Certificate course features a dataset for the Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing New Horizons. During the height of the pandemic, I enjoyed collecting my favorite villagers in the game, and quickly discovered there were some villagers players loved more than others. Since I’m in the process of learning SQL, I thought it would be fun to use the tool to see if there were specific characteristics that made villagers more popular with the ACNH player community. A few Kaggle users have created similar projects using Python, but for this project I’ll be putting my SQL skills to the test.

**Datasets:**

-   Jessi Li: [Animal Crossing New Horizons Catalog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset?select=villagers.csv)
    
-   [Animal Crossing Villager Popularity](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ampiiere/acnh-villager-popularity?resource=download)
    

**Goals:**

1.  What is the most popular villager gender? Are there more male or female villagers?
    
2.  What is the most/least popular villager personality?
    
3.  What is the most popular animal type? How many villagers are there per animal type?
    
4.  What is the most/least popular Zodiac sign of the villagers?

5.  What is most/least popular villager combination by gender, personality, animal, and Zodiac sign?
